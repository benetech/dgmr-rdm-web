          For the graphs, the image descriptions are short enough that only alt text is needed. An appropriate description for the first graph is:"A vertical parabola with the vertex at (1, -1)."An appropriate description for the second graph is:"A vertical parabola with the vertex at (0, -1). The parabola crosses the following points: (1, 0); (-1, 0); (2, 3); (-2, 3)."

        <h2 id="makeaccessible">Making This Image Accessible</h2>

        <p class="noind">This page can be made accessible using MathML, image descriptions, and sonification. The choice of modality varies depending on factors such as the information to be conveyed, grade level, student knowledge and experience, and the image itself. The complete HTML5 + MathML file and the MP3 audio files are available from the <a href="../Text/sourcefiles.xhtml">source files</a> list.</p>

        <p class="ind">How an image description is displayed depends on the reading tool being used. In most mainstream reading tools, the description will not be displayed at all, but in tools designed for accessibility (or mainstream tools with accessible features enabled), the description could be displayed below the image, voiced as part of the content, or both.</p>
