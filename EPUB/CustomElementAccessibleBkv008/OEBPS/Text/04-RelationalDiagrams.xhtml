      <h3>Making This Image Accessible</h3>

      <p class="ind">This image can be made accessible with an image description. Radial and Web diagrams are often used to show relationships between concepts and ideas. Simple radial diagrams like the one shown above, can be described in a few sentences. Complex radial diagrams require converting information into an outline.</p>

            This should be the default approach, especially for lower grade levels. A tree diagram shows different branches of science. There are three levels, from top to bottom. The highest level is Natural Science. The next level has Physical Science, Earth and Space Science, and Life Science. Physical Science includes Physics and Chemistry. Earth and Space Science includes Geology, Meteorology, Astronomy, and Oceanography. Life Science includes Botany, Ecology, Zoology, and Genetics.

            This   approach is appropriate for high school grade levels, where students are comfortable navigating bulleted lists with a screen reader. A tree diagram shows different branches of science. There are three levels, from top to bottom. The highest level is Natural Science. The next level has Physical Science, Earth and Space Science, and Life Science.

        <h3>Making This Image Accessible</h3>

        <p class="first">
          This image can be made accessible with an image description. Hierarchy and Tree diagrams are often used to show relationships between types of activities, ideas, or responsibilities, such as roles in an organization. These diagrams can be all text or a combination of text and illustrations. Since the layers of these diagrams can become complex, it is important to know the purpose of the diagram and the intended audience. For this reason, three different descriptions for three different audiences are provided for this diagram.
